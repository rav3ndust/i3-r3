# wired window manager
=====

### Welcome to the Wired

**wiredWM** is rav3ndust's personal fork of i3, which is a tiling window manager for X11.

## minimal and lightweight 

![wiredWM desktop](imgs/wiredWM_flameshot1.png) 
###### minimal desktop and keyboard-driven for quick efficiency. clickable icons are located at the bottom of the status bar for common tasks- for those unfortunate occasions where you have to reach for the mouse

Easy to use and easily extensible. Takes up very little of precious system resources, and gives you a minimal but efficient keyboard-driven environment, so you can focus less on messing around with bells and whistles found on prominent desktop environments and focus more on the task at hand. It *is* a tiling window manager, and these sorts of WMs are well-loved for how efficient and extensible they can be. 

**Clickable launchers for:**

- Sound control (handled through `volumeicon-alsa`).
- Screenshot utility (handles via `flameshot`.)
- Network/Wi-Fi manager (handles via `nm-applet`.)

## more resources for your stuff

###### browse the web and run all of your favorite applications in a minimal environment 

Just open up the **nightshade launcher** by pressing *crtl+d* - that launches a custom **dmenu** script, and you can search for and launch your applications with ease. Think of it as your miniature Start panel.

For a general list of applications, you can also press *ctrl+Shift+a* and scroll through to select one. Anything that has a desktop entry will appear here.

## organize your windows with ease

###### automate the organization of the windows on your screen

A bunch of floating windows can become difficult to manage in the middle of a workflow - which is another reason a tiling window manager can really come in handy. Being built on top of the much-loved **i3**, **wiredWM** allows you to easily tile or float your windows with a quick keyboard shortcut.

### custom stuff

**wiredWM** also contains: 

- *nightshader*, a custom **dmenu** for running commands and launching applications.
- scripts for lock screen with password via **i3lock-fancy**
- my own custom scripts built on top of [suckless's](https://suckless.org) **surf** browser.
- a custom **conky** config
- various other assorted things
- custom keyboard shortcuts for some of the scripts we've built in
