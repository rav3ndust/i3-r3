# nightshadeWM
=====================================================

**nightshadeWM** is rav3ndust's personal fork of i3, which is a tiling window manager for X11.

For more information about i3, please see [the project's website](https://i3wm.org/) and [online documentation](https://i3wm.org/docs/). I'll be updating docs for this fork soon.

You're of course more than free to contribute to my fork, but if you want to check out more information about contributing to the OG i3, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
