# 10:30 Call Notes | Shaun, Jacobo, Derreck, Irene

## Meeting Minutes

Congratulations to Jacobo and co. on going public! 


Everything that we get to do in the future is going to be thanks to the success we achieve with our RP project. 

If we can create an incredible impact with RP, then we will have clients jumping to work with us. 

With the focus being on RP, the current timeline is still good to go - and after we go through this cycle, it will make other cycles seem shorter!

There will always still be the need for maintenance with the assets as time goes on. 

It is good to create proposals for other clients, but it shouldn't come at the expense of missing out on getting things done for this project. 

Visibility and communication is still top-priority as we continue to push forward on the project and make sure that everyone is on the same page. 

Derreck putting together the weekly update in terms of where we are in the project, what is coming next, and what the teams have reached (project summary).
  
We need to know what is going on with the assets and what it looks like so that we can continue to go on. Are we missing the point of actual **due dates** or making sure the team lets each other know what they have been working on? 

*What would be best for Jacobo and Irene if they were updated directly by Derreck?*

There will be an update from each team: 

- What have we accomplished? 
- What is still outstanding?

#### Irene Note: 

>It would also help if everyone would work on a shared document or Google Doc so that everyone is able to have a single format to deliver on. 
>> The team could use Google Docs in order to collaborate on a single source, since everyone has simple access to Google Docs and the editing can be shared. 

We need a common repository where everything is stored, and where everyone has access to it (**_A Google Drive could be ideal_**)

It is important to make sure the Creative team is kept in the loop with what the other teams have been up to so that everyone is able to be on the same page. 

If we all work from the same doc, it can be easier (*both for client-side and for the sake of convenience for the team*)

#### Derreck note (ClickUp): 

In ClickUp, you can create **Docs**, overall visibility and where things are can be found in the **Toolbox**. 

There are updates, software wikis, reference links, roadmaps, and more. Is this something that makes sense for the team? 

One thing that can happen with info siloing (do I upload something to ClickUp or Slack) is that there might be too many places where something can be stored.  

Copy the public Google Doc into ClickUp and then Slack for reference - this way there are not multiple places where the files can be found. 

When there are smaller groups in a call, Derreck will do calendar invites. Doodle makes more sense for bigger calls. 

#### Jacobo Notes: 

We need to take care of the timezones of the team. If we can keep everyone in the loop and make sure that we are keeping peoples' schedules in mind, we will be able to communicate and meet much more efficiently. 

### Wrap-Up Notes

The team is flexible, and knowing everyone's parts of the world and keeping their time zones in consideration is an important part in getting everyone in sync for meetings/working.

This next meeting is about making sure to educate them on NFTs - show them value through explanation of the technologies we are working with and bringing to market. 

Irene is going to change the doc for the client so they don't know all about the strategy, but with some inspirational messaging about innovation, etc.
